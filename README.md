# cyberpunk-2077-character-planner

The website is character builder for the upcoming RPG, Cyberpunk 2077. It's a sequel to the classic tabletop game created by Mike Ponsmith and the game is being developed by CD Projekt Red; the developers of The Witcher game trilogy. 


## Main Hub

The main index is the main Hub of the website. It's original intent was to be a place where the user can upload their characters and others can view them and even copy the character schematics of they liked the design. I was also going to have a hidden sidebar be a live feed to the Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter feed, but decided against it because I apparently need a developers kit.

## Login and Registration

The registration is bcrypt, and you don't need an email, just a username and passport. The login is passport and you are still required to be loved in if you want to use the character planner.

## Character Planner - Background

My options were limited due to a lot of the info of the game not being public yet. The whole point of this section is essentially your head cannon. Since the set name is "V", I set it as an alias and made a name input since it's unknown if "V" is the birth name or nickname. The age is probably set, but it's still included. Ethnicity is mainly there in place due to the lack of character creation being revealed yet, because the previous one shown in the 2018 gameplay is now outdated. The background is where you set your V's backstory and can make them anywhere from an exiled Nomad who became a Corpo to a complete degenerate mistake of society. You do you.

## Character Planner - Build

This is the stats planner of your game. Here is how you plan out your gameplay. You first select the character and choose the offical game background an class. There were suppose to be pictures included, but problems arosed.
